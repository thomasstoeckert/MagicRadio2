TODO: Rewrite most of this

I think the DJ logic is salvagable, as well as the data structure for stations and segments - but the tuner'll have to get rewritten entirely.

Everything that comes out of the MagicRadio is going to be a "Station" - bluetooth, spotify, streamed web audio, simulated stations. Going to have to figure out the abstraction for that, then fit this back in.
